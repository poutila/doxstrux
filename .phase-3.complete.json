  "notes": "Deprecated sanitize() method to non-mutating wrapper. Removed 2 regex patterns (link/image extraction) by reusing _apply_security_policy() which already handles validation via tokens. Moved path traversal pattern to Phase 6 (retained security regex). Performance improved: removed heavy second parse from sanitize(). All 10 Phase 3 tests passing."
