## How to Use This Archive

### Finding Historical Information

1. **Implementation history (Parts 1-9)**: Check `plans/PLAN_CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION_extended_[1-9].md`
2. **Part 10 (superseded)**: Check `plans/PLAN_CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION_extended_10.md` (note: superseded by Part 11)
3. **Execution reports (Parts 5-13)**: Check `execution_reports/PART*_COMPLETE.md`
4. **P0-P3 detailed reports**: Check `p0_p3_reports/`
5. **Old checklists**: Check `exec_reports/EXEC_*.md`
6. **Completion summaries**: Check `misc/`

### Git History

All archived files remain in git history. To view a file's history:

```bash
git log --follow archived/plans/PLAN_CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION_extended_10.md
```

### Restoration

If you need to restore an archived file to active use:

```bash
# Example: restore Part 10 plan
cp archived/plans/PLAN_CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION_extended_10.md .
```

**Note**: Before restoring, check if the information is already in CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION.md (v3.0)

---

## Archive Maintenance Policy

### Retention
- **Keep indefinitely**: All archived files (git history preservation)
- **Review annually**: Check if any archived files can be deleted (if never referenced)
- **Compress if needed**: After 1 year, consider compressing to `archived.tar.gz`

### Updates
- **No updates**: Archived files are frozen (historical snapshots)
- **Active documents only**: Only update files in parent directory

### References
- **Broken links expected**: Internal links in archived files may point to archived/moved files
- **Use git grep**: To find references to archived files in active docs

## Consolidation Impact

### Before Consolidation
- ❌ 61 markdown files
- ❌ 52,585 lines
- ❌ 70% redundancy in master status docs
- ❌ 40-60% redundancy in execution reports
- ❌ Difficult to find canonical source

### After Consolidation
- ✅ 18 active files (7 essential + 11 operational)
- ✅ ~15,000 active lines (70% reduction)
- ✅ Single source of truth (CLOSING_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- ✅ Easy navigation (README → 7 essential files)
- ✅ History preserved in archived/
