name: Adversarial Full Suite (PR + Nightly)

# CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT:
# This workflow MUST be a required status check for merging to main/develop.
# Without this gate, regressions can slip through.
#
# Per External Security Audit D1:
# - Run adversarial corpora as blocking CI gate
# - Upload artifacts for forensic analysis
# - Fail CI on any adversarial test failure
#
# Evidence Anchor: CLAIM-D1-CI-GATE
